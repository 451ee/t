WAS IST DAS?
-------------

An idea to combine:
+ Telnet talker interface
+ Node.js
+ HTML5


CURRENT STATUS
-------------

This mockup can pretend to work with these commands:
+ .w - who - who is in the chatroom
+ .h - help - help
+ .c - che cazzo - curse in italian

Try it out www.451.ee/t

With very little HTML+CSS it's already usable on mobile + bigger screens.


FIRST VERSION
-------------

Ideas for first version:

Users:
Ability to log in and out. With local user + perhaps some log-in services.

Rooms / groupchat:
Ability to create rooms. Private & public.

Communication: 
.tell <user> <message> - send a private message.
.emote would also be nice.


WHY? 
----
+ I think the text based user interface deserves another go.
+ "Rooms" could be used for group chatting.
+ Skype/FB doesn't let you do your own emoticons.
+ I started talking with two friends from a telnet talker I used to visit more than 10 years ago and it felt good to talk with them.
+ There are groups of former talker admins who know how to keep these online communities.
