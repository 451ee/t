WAS IST DAS?
-------------

An idea to combine:
+ Telnet talker interface
+ Node.js
+ HTML5


CURRENT STATUS
-------------

This mockup can pretend to work with these commands:
.w - who - who is in the chatroom
.h - help - help
.c - che cazzo - italian expression "che cazzo!"

Try it out www.451.ee/t

With very little HTML+CSS it's allready usable on mobile + bigger screens.


FIRST VERSION
-------------

Ideas for first version:

Users:
Ability to log in and out. With local user + perhaps some log-in services.

Rooms / groupchat:
Ability to create rooms. Private & public.

Communication: 
Together with just chatting also a possibility to send private messages as in
.tell <user> <message>. Also .emote would be nice.


WHY? 
----
-> I think the text based user interface deserves another go.
-> "Rooms" could be used for group chatting.
-> Skype/FB doesn't let you do your own emotcons.
-> I hooked up with two friends from a telnet talker I used to visit more then 10 years ago and it felt good to talk with them.
-> There are groups of former talker admins who know how to keep these communities.
